- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @t3chstop

I am going to enter my junior year of high school this fall. I am working on several software skills in an effort to be a large contributor to open source projects. I believe
that open source software is the best software and I love to learn. I am currently working on a few projects, in web development mostly, and I am interested in learning more about
machine learning. Feel free to get in touch, here or on discord(t3chstop#6969)
